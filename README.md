# Bloomtrace App Store Pages

This folder contains the static pages required for App Store Connect:

- `index.html` — Support page users can visit for help.
- `privacy.html` — Privacy policy page describing how Bloomtrace handles data.

## Usage

1. Review and replace the placeholder email addresses (`support@yourdomain.com`, `feedback@yourdomain.com`, `privacy@yourdomain.com`) with real contact details.
2. Update the privacy policy sections to accurately reflect your data collection, analytics partners, and retention practices.
3. Create a new public repository on GitHub (for example `bloomtrace-pages`) and copy these files into it.
4. Enable GitHub Pages for the repository (`Settings` ▶ `Pages`) and choose the `main` branch and `/root` directory.
5. Grab the published URLs to use as the Support URL and Privacy Policy URL in App Store Connect.

You can customize the styling or add more sections before publishing.

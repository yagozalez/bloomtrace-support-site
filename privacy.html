      <h1>Bloomtrace Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: March 2025</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Bloomtrace keeps your plant collection private. The app only stores the information you add so it can run its core features, and it does not build marketing profiles, run ads, or sell data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information We Store</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Plant library:</strong> Plant names, spaces, species, health status, growth measurements, and any notes you enter.</li>
        <li><strong>Care history:</strong> Care event details (type, date, notes) and optional attachments you create.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos & media:</strong> Images you capture or import for plants, care events, or growth records. Media files are saved inside the app sandbox and used only to show you your photos.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription status:</strong> Whether you have unlocked Bloomtrace Premium, as reported by Apple and our purchase provider. No billing details are ever sent to us.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-device first:</strong> All information lives on your iPhone or iPad. Removing the app deletes the local copy.</li>
        <li><strong>Private iCloud sync:</strong> If you are signed in to iCloud, Bloomtrace uses Apple&#39;s CloudKit private database so that your own devices stay in sync. This data is stored in your personal iCloud account and is not visible to us.</li>
        <li><strong>Media storage:</strong> Photos remain inside Bloomtrace&#39;s local storage. They are never uploaded anywhere except your own iCloud account when sync is enabled.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple iCloud and App Store:</strong> Used for data sync, backups, and in-app purchases. Apple processes this information under its <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Handles premium subscription status and restores past purchases. RevenueCat receives anonymous identifiers tied to your Apple receipt so it can confirm entitlements. See the <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/">RevenueCat Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bloomtrace does not integrate analytics, advertising SDKs, or social media trackers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Edit or delete plants, events, and photos directly inside the app.</li>
        <li>Delete Bloomtrace to remove local data. To clear the iCloud copy, open your device settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; iCloud &gt; Manage Account Storage and delete Bloomtrace data.</li>
        <li>Contact us if you need help accessing or removing information stored in CloudKit.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children&#39;s Privacy</h2>
      <p>Bloomtrace is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you learn that a child has shared information with us, please reach out so we can delete it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy as Bloomtrace evolves. Significant changes will be highlighted in the app release notes or on this page.</p>
